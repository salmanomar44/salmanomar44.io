What’s a non-technical skill you’ve developed that you’re most proud of?One non-technical skill I’m proud of is empathy also showing love and care. When I worked as a Mental Health Specialist, I supported people going through tough situations. I had to stay calm, listen carefully, and be patient. That experience helped me become a better communicator and team member, both in work and in life.

Tell me about a time you faced a major technical obstacle. How did you resolve it? While working on an NFL injury data project, I ran into a problem where the data was messy and inconsistent. Some files were missing information, and others had different formats. To fix it, I wrote Python scripts to clean the data and used SQL to check that everything matched correctly. It was frustrating at first but I learned how important it is to stay organized and break big problems into smaller steps.

What’s something new you learned on your own that really impacted your work? One thing that I learned myself that was most useful to me was how to use Power BI. I learned by following tutorials and practicing with test data because I wanted to get good at taking raw numbers and making them easy to view. Later, I used Power BI in my work to create dashboards that helped track important health service measures. Learning independently made me more confident with information, and it allowed my team to make wiser decisions through simplified understanding of trends.
